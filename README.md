# Waro Map Tool

This repository contains the source files for Motu's online tool for mapping Māori-owned land in the East Cape.

The tool was created by [Sam Liberman](https://motu.nz/about-us/people/sam-liberman/) for [the Waro project](https://waro.nz/).
Its intended use is for Māori landowners to visualise land eligibility for the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme and for the Gisborne district’s Erosion Control Funding Programme.

## Usage

The map can be viewed [here](https://moturesearch.github.io/waro-map-tool).
It can also be downloaded for offline use by creating a local copy of this repository and opening `index.html`.
